# React js Life Cycle

## What is Life Cycle Methods In React?

### Introduction:

In React.js, a life cycle refers to the different stages a React component goes through from its creation to its destruction. The life cycle methods are special methods in a React component that allow you to hook into these stages and run specific code at certain points during a component's life

With the introduction of React 16.3 and later, some class-based life cycle methods like `componentWillMount,` `componentWillReceiveProps`, and `componentWillUpdate` were deprecated due to their potential for causing bugs and inconsistent behavior. React introduced Hooks as a more powerful and flexible way to manage component state and side effects in functional components. Hooks like `useEffect`, `useState`, and `useContext` allow developers to handle life cycle events, state management, and context in a clean, consistent manner, eliminating the need for some of the older class-based life cycle methods. This shift towards Hooks has made functional components more robust and easier to work with.
